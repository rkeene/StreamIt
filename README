DESCRIPTION
  StreamIt is a generic media streamer.  It has no code related to any
  specific file format or codec, but rather relies on the clients to
  rate-limit the stream.  It is also uses very minimal CPU, and can be run
  on a 386 or 486 quite well.

USAGE
  streamit -p <port> <file> [<file> [<file> [...]]]

  Where "<port>" is the port number to listen on for connections. And "<file>"
  is the name of a file to stream.

  Note that each file should be in a format that can be concatenated together
  since they will be shifted through seamlessly, and looped back to the first
  file.  Also, the file format should be such that a client can pick anywhere
  in the file and begin to interpret it.
  
EXAMPLE
  streamit -p 8081 *.mp3

  (Where *.mp3 expands by your shell to a list of MP3 files encoded at the
   same bit-rate and audio parameters, otherwise clients streaming the
   MPEG stream might get confused.)
